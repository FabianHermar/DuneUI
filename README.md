# DuneUI

**DuneUI** is a UI component library built on **TailwindCSS**, designed to simplify the creation of modern and accessible web interfaces. No need to install additional packages—just copy and paste the component code, and use the power of TailwindCSS to customize everything to your needs.

## Features

- **TailwindCSS-based**: All components are styled using TailwindCSS utilities, allowing you to easily tweak and adjust styles.
- **Production-ready components**: Copy and paste components directly into your project with no extra dependencies.
- **Accessibility**: Components are designed following best accessibility practices.
- **Framework-agnostic**: Works in any project that uses TailwindCSS, with no additional JavaScript required.

## Getting Started

2. Browse the [DuneUI documentation](https://duneui.com/docs) to find the component you need.
3. Copy the component’s code.
4. Paste it into your project and adjust the TailwindCSS classes as needed.
